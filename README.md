# calculator
## Introduction
This project is my attempt at the final project of the The Odin Project's Foundations Course. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this calculator features basic left-to-right expression evaluation involving the four basic arithmetic operators.

## After-thoughts
This project proved to be a fun challenge when it came to figuring out how to evaluate the expression. I felt like it allowed me to come up with some interesting strategies, such as reversing a JavaScript array in order to take advantage of the built-in push() and pop() methods to treat it as a queue.

The CSS could definitely use some work, and I had further ideas about additional functionality, including implementing infix-evaluation for brackets, as well as adding a "display history".
